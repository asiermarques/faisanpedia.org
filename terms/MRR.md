# MRR

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), represents the monthly revenue for a subscription. Recurring charges must be normalized to a monthly value (e.g., quarterly divided by 3). For example, if the business sells annual plans or half-yearly plans or quarterly plans, then the revenue amount is divided by 12, 6, and 4, respectively. To calculate, add up all the customer level MRR from all active subscriptions.

There are many nuances in the calculation of MRR:

MRR does not include any one-time charges such as activation fees or setup fees
MRR does not include any subscriptions which are suspended
Businesses can choose to include usage charges. Businesses will have to use an estimated usage or a minimum commitment to compute the MRR for usage charges. Most business who offers their services in usage-based or consumption-based model will have to estimate the usage for revenue reporting as per the new ASC 606/IFRS15 compliance standards.
Businesses can also track and monitor the MRR from new customer accounts, product upgrades, and product downgrades.
